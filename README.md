HI, I'm Silver! My moscot is my Doberman, Aurelius, he's a good boy.



 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a freelance, full stack, Web Developer, that is now Developing iOS apps with Swift.

 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I would be an incredible asset to your Dev team and how I can help you!
 

 âš¡ Fun fact: I love to travel, I am learning how to surf, and spin fire poi! One day I will spin fire at a bonfire on the beach, and there will be drums, dancing and howling at the moon.
